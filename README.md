# **Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. By applying the K-Means clustering algorithm, we identify patterns in the data to help businesses optimize marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and allocate resources more effectively.

---

## **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Group customers into clusters based on similar behavior and characteristics.
- Provide insights that help businesses tailor their offerings to different customer segments.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** Kaggle (Customer Segmentation Dataset)
- **Features:**
  - `Age` - Age of the customer.
  - `Annual Income (k$)` - Annual income of the customer in thousands.
  - `Spending Score (1-100)` - A score assigned based on customer behavior and spending nature.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform:** Google Colab
- **Algorithm:** K-Means Clustering

---

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and duplicates.
   - Scaled numeric features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Selected key features: `Age`, `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`.
   
2. **Clustering:**
   - Used the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into 3 clusters.
   - Determined clusters based on purchasing power and spending behavior.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Created a 2D scatter plot to represent clusters for easy interpretation.

4. **Results:**
   - Segmented customers into actionable groups:
     - **Cluster 0:** Budget-conscious customers (low income, low spending).
     - **Cluster 1:** Premium customers (high income, high spending).
     - **Cluster 2:** Average customers (moderate income, moderate spending).

## **How to Run**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
   ```
2. Open the `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Upload the dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`) to the runtime environment.
4. Follow the notebook instructions to preprocess, cluster, and visualize the data.

---

## **Key Insights**
- High-income customers with high spending scores represent premium customers who can be targeted for premium offers.
- Low-income customers with low spending scores may need discounts or budget-friendly strategies.
- Moderate-income customers form the average group, suitable for standard offers.

---

## **Future Scope**
- Optimize the number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
- Use additional features or advanced clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering) for deeper analysis.
- Integrate with real-world customer data for further validation.
